# CS231n 2020: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition - Assignment Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments of the [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) course offered by Stanford University (Spring 2020).
Assignments using deep-learning frameworks are solved with only Pytorch.

- [Q2](): Training a Support Vector Machine. (_Done_)
- [Q3](): Implement a Softmax classifier. (_Done_)
- [Q4](): Two-Layer Neural Network. (_Done_)

### Assignment 2:
- [Q1](): Fully-connected Neural Network. (_Done_)
- [Q2](): Batch Normalization. (_Done_)
- [Q3](): Dropout. (_Done_)
- [Q4](): Convolutional Networks. (_Done_)
- [Q5](): PyTorch / TensorFlow on CIFAR-10. (_Done_)

### Assignment 3:
- [Q1](): Image Captioning with Vanilla RNNs. (_Done_)
- [Q2](): Image Captioning with LSTMs. (_Done_)
- [Q3](): Network Visualization: Saliency maps, Class Visualization, and Fooling Images. (_Done_)
