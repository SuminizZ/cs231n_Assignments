# CS231n 2020: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition - Assignment Solutions

Contains my solutions for the assignments of the [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) course offered by Stanford University (Spring 2020).
Assignments using deep-learning frameworks are solved only with Pytorch.

### Assignment 1
